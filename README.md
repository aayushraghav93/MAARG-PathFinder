PathFinder: Implementing Data Structures for Efficient Geolocation Services
Features

1.Add Cities:

Users can add cities to the map by providing a unique city ID and a city name.


2.Add Paths:

Connect cities with paths, specifying the distance between them. Users can also set the availability of the path.


3.Display Graph:

Visualize the graph with cities and distances to understand the spatial layout.


4.Remove Cities:

Remove cities from the map, updating the graph accordingly.


5.Find Shortest Path:

Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities. Displays the path and total distance.


6.Persistence:

The graph state is serialized to a file (graph.ser) for persistent storage between program runs.


7.Data Structures

The Location Pathfinder employs the following data structures:

8.LocationGraph:

Represents the map with an adjacency matrix to store distances between cities.
Uses arrays to manage cities and their paths efficiently.


9.City:

Represents a city with a unique ID and a name.

10.Path:

Represents a path between two cities with distance and availability information.
Getting Started


11.Compile and Run:

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
Compile and run the Main class to launch the Location Pathfinder.


12.Menu Options:

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the application.
Options include adding cities, adding paths, displaying the graph, removing cities, and finding the shortest path
